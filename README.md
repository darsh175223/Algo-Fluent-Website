Algofluent is an interactive e-learning platform designed to simplify complex Computer Science concepts through dynamic visualizations and gamification. Built with React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it offers a comprehensive suite of 20+ interactive visualizations for data structures, algorithms, regression models, neural networks, and programming lessons. In addition, it includes a schedule session feature that uses AI Agents to recommend topics adn schedule a personalized study plan on Google Calendar based on user experience level.

Key features include:
- Interactive visualizations for various data structures and algorithms
- Gamification elements to boost user engagement
- User authentication using the MERN stack
- Handwritten digit recognition powered by a Flask-based microservice with TensorFlow
- Robust deployment using Kubernetes for high availability and efficient resource management
- Automated study planner


## Features

### Data Structure Visualizations
-  Add or delete elements and see the structure update in real-time.

### Algorithm Visualizations
- **Sorting algorithms**: An interactive visualizer with a slider to adjust the array size, a sort button, and a bar graph to display the array.
- **Linear Regression**: Add points to an interactive coordinate graph, which generates and updates a regression line automatically.
- **Logistic Regression**: Visualize logistic regression using Chart.js and the `ml-logistic-regression` library.

### Additional Features
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Draw a number on a canvas and have it recognized by a Python-based program.
- **User Authentication**: MERN stack implementation for user sign-in and account creation.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built with ReactJS.
  - **Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizers**: Various components for visualizing data structures and algorithms.
  - **User Authentication**: Components for sign-in and account creation pages.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.
  - **User Authentication**: RESTful APIs for managing user data.
  - **Digit Recognition**: Python-based service for recognizing handwritten digits.
- **Deployment**: Deployed using Docker and Render.
